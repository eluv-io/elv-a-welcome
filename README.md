When you want to log in to utilize the Fabric Browser, Video Editor, etc. click the Account Name, and you will be prompted to enter your wallet password set in 3 above to unlock the account​ and you are “logged in”. To switch accounts use the control in upper right corner. Switching effectively locks the previous account’s wallet and unlocks the target next account’s wallet.
